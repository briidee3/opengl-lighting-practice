# opengl-lighting-practice
OpenGL Lighting Practice, following tutorials on learnopengl.com

The purpose of this repo was essentially so I could get a bit more experience using git/github, as well as to store a backup of
a project I was working on that can be accessed from all of my devices. That way, I could learn to be more efficient with git/github,
as well as being able to work on the project from any of my devices.
