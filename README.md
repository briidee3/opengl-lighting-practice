OpenGL Lighting Practice, following tutorials on [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/)

The purpose of this repo was essentially so I could get a bit more experience using git/github, as well as to store a backup of
a project I was working on that can be accessed from all of my devices. That way, I could learn to be more efficient with git/github,
as well as being able to work on the project from any of my devices.

> This was a project I did for a class I took a couple years ago in college, in which the students chose a programming language and created a
> presentation to teach the class a bit about it. My chosen language here was GLSL, and so I decided to follow a (relatively) simple [guide](https://learnopengl.com/) 
> to create a 3D environment in which I could render objects, utilizing GLSL along with OpenGL to create a 3D environment that one could
> navigate with their keyboard and mouse.
> This was more or less just a way to learn and exemplify some of the capabilities of OpenGL, since it is a fairly popular
> graphics library that is used all over a wide array of fields in order to present things on screen in a nice, very customizable way,
> with precise control over what is shown on screen.
